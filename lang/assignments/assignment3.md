## Autonomy of syntax: Disadvantages for experimental cognitive science

Throughout _Syntactic structures_ Chomsky derives formal methods for verifying and analysing human language syntax
(Chomsky 1957). By segragating syntax from semantics Chomsky argues that '_we are forced to conclude that grammar is autonomous and independent of meaning_' (Chomsky 1957, p. 17). While Chomsky has proven that it is possible
to construct syntax computationally, he raises a plenitude of questions about language ambiguity and semantics.

This paper argues how this generative approach is a disadvantage to the field of experimental cognitive science. By
relating an article on orthographic processing of baboons (Grainter et al. 2006)[^1] to the idea of autonomy of
syntax, this paper includes novel research on semantics and meaning representation and finally concludes on
how the most recent development relates to the Chomskyan heritage.
