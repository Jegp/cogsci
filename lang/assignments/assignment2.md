## Autonomy of syntax: Advantages for experimental cognitive science

Throughout _Syntactic structures_ Chomsky derives formal methods for verifying and analysing human language syntax
(Chomsky 1957). These methods prove that it is possible to understand the syntax, but raises a plenitude
of questions about language semantics.
This paper argues how this generative theories is - and has been - an advantage for the search of semantics
within the field of experimental cognitive science. By explaining how generative theories of language can
instruct the search for meaning in a cognitive system, this paper proceeds to relate this search to two
examples, finally concluding on the prospects of the current line of research.


By segragating syntax from semantics he argues that '_we are forced to conclude that grammar is autonomous
and independent of meaning_' (Chomsky 1957, p. 17). In this paper I
